# Charik Backend Developer Technical Test

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the backend technical test for Charik. It includes a Django REST Framework application that integrates with HubSpot's API to manage contacts and deals. The application is containerized using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Make sure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your machine.
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed for containerization.
- **HubSpot API Key**: You need a HubSpot API key to interact with HubSpot's API.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chouia-Abderrahman/Charik-Backend-Interview-Chouia-Abderrahman.git
cd Charik-Backend-Interview-Chouia-Abderrahman
```

### 2. Environment variables:

go to the env file located in
```bash
/hubspot_integration/django_api
```
and replace the token placeholder with your hubspot api key:
```bash
TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

### 3. Docker setup:

Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t charik-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env charik-backend
